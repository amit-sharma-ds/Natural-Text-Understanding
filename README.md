# Sentiment Analysis Project Explanation
# 📦 Amazon Review Sentiment Analyzer

This project is an **Amazon Review Sentiment Analyzer** that classifies customer reviews as **positive** ✅ or **negative** ❌ using advanced deep learning models like **RNN**, **LSTM**, and **GRU**. The core idea was to intersect AI with different technologies across the stack to build a **robust and efficient sentiment analysis system**.

It involves:
- 🧹 Text preprocessing  
- 🔤 Tokenization  
- 📏 Sequence padding  

All to prepare data for the neural network models.
